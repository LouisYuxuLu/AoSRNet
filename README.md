> **Abstract:** *Scattering and attenuation of light in no-homogeneous imaging media or inconsistent light intensity will cause insufficient contrast and color distortion in the collected images, which limits the developments such as vision-driven smart urban, autonomous vehicles, and intelligent robots. In this paper, we propose an all-in-one scene recovery network via multi-knowledge integration (AoSRNet) to improve the visibility of imaging devices in typical low-visibility imaging scenes (e.g., haze, sand dust, and low light). It combines gamma correction (GC) and optimized linear stretching (OLS) to create the detail enhancement module (DEM) and color restoration module (CRM). Additionally, we suggest a multi-receptive field extraction module (MEM) to attenuate the loss of image texture details caused by GC nonlinear and OLS linear transformations. Finally, we refine the coarse features generated by DEM, CRM, and MEM through Encoder-Decoder to generate the final restored image. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of AoSRNet compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
